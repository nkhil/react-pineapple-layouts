In time of dire need, young Billy has been granted the power by the Immortals to summon awesome forces at the utterance of a single word - SHAZAM - a word which transforms him in a flash into the mightiest of mortal beings, Captain Marvel! Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out. Welcome back, to that same old place that you laughed about. Well, the names have all changed since you hung around, but those dreams have remained and they\'re turned around. Who\'d have thought they\'d lead ya? Here where we need ya. Yeah, we tease him a lot \'cause we\'ve got him on the spot, welcome back. Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. Somewhere out in space live The Herculoids! Zok, the laser-ray dragon! Igoo, the giant rock ape! Tundro, the tremendous! Gloop and Gleep, the formless, fearless wonders! With Zandor, their leader, and his wife, Tara, and son, Dorno, they team up to protect their planet from sinister invaders! All-strong! All-brave! All-heroes! They\'re The Herculoids!\nLady Godiva was a freedom rider, she didn\'t care if the whole world looked. Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her, she was a sister who really cooked. Isadora was the first bra burner, ain\'t you glad she showed up. And when the country was falling apart Betsy Ross got it all sewed up. And then there\'s Maude. That old compromisin\', enterprisin\', anything but tranquilizing, right-on Maude.'

We work hard, but who\'s complaining. Thanks to the I.L.G. we\'re paying our way. So always look for the Union Label. It means we\'re able to make it in the U.S.A.!'

Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again. Didn\'t need no welfare state, everybody pulled his weight. Gee our old LaSalle ran great. Those were the days.'

You wanna be where everybody knows your name. You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, you wanna go where everybody knows your name.'
